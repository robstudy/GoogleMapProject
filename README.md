Run the Neightborhood Map by opening the index.html file in a web browser. 

The application displays a list of chinese and japanese restaurants in Clovis, CA (the town which I live). The list is preselected from a JSON file I created. The list can be filtered with the searchbar and clicking on a restuarant, either on the list or marker, will open yelp data for that location. Ratings, image, telephone, and review will display in the infowindow. You can go to the yelp page by clicking the image in the infowindow.

Hovering over markers will change color from pink and azure. Pink is a clicked or hovered marker, and azure is an unselected marker.
